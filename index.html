                    My name is Katelyn Nguyen. 
                    I am a proud member of the fighting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas Aggie</a> class of 2025! 
                    I am a computer engineering major pursuing minors in mathematics and cybersecurity.
                    Outside the classroom, I am involved in several organizations, including HKN-IEEE honor society, Vietnamese Student Association, Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers, and Aggie Women in Computer Science.
                    I also love spending my free time dancing, playing Minecraft, and solving nonogram puzzles.

                <p>
                    I decided to pursue a <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/electrical-computer/computer-engineering-bs/#programrequirementstext">Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering</a> because of the fascination with the inner workings of electronic devices my dad helped foster within me. 
                    As a kid, I got to spend some of my dad’s extra vacation days messing around with junk from all over the house. 
                    I loved dismantling old toys and electronics to gain hands-on experience with their components as well as learn how they functioned. 
                    I was especially intrigued by the complexity and abstractness that exists between hardware and code that powered these devices.
                    I hope this craving to learn more about this field continues and I hope to deepen my understanding by completing a degree in this field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before my junior year of high school, I had no idea there was a major that combined both the hardware and software aspects of technology I had grown so fond of. 
                    Once I learned that Computer Engineering perfectly aligned with my interests, I’ve been very passionate about this degree. 
                    This major allows me to merge my fondness for technology with my desire to create and innovate. 
                    One day, I hope to work with a tech company and play a role in the creation and testing of devices like laptops to contribute to the constantly evolving field.

                <p>
                    With technology growing rapidly, I aspire to utilize my education and skills to become a key component in the industry.
                    In the immediate future, my objective is to secure summer internships that will afford me genuine, hands-on technical experience. This is not solely about acquiring skills, but also an opportunity for self-discovery. I hope to truly identify my strengths, discern optimal work environments, and immerse myself in diverse cultures and cityscapes. 
                    Looking ahead, my overarching goal is to achieve success in any reputable company. I aspire to be proud of the work I do and find joy in contributing to meaningful and impactful projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this upcoming summer specificially, my goal is to obtain a full-time internship in areas relating to either software or hardware.
