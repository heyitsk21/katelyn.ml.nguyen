                    My name is Katelyn Nguyen. 
                    I am a proud member of the fighting Texas Aggie class of 2025! 
                    I am a computer engineering major pursuing minors in mathematics and cybersecurity.
                    Outside the classroom, I am involved in several organizations, including HKN-IEEE honor society, Vietnamese Student Association, Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers, and Aggie Women in Computer Science.

                    Why Computer Engineering?
                </h1>
        
                <p>
                    I decided to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering because of the fascination with the inner workings of electronic devices my dad helped foster within me. 
                    As a kid, I got to spend some of my dad’s extra vacation days messing around with junk from all over the house. 
                    I loved dismantling old toys and electronics to hands-on experience with their components as well as learning how they functioned. 
                    I was especially intrigued by the complexity and abstractness between hardware and code that powered these devices and I hope to continue to deepen my understanding by pursuing this field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before my junior year of high school, I had no idea there was a major that combined both the hardware and software aspects of technology I had grown fond of. 
                    Once I learned that CPEN perfectly aligned with my interests, I’ve been very passionate about this degree. 
                    This major allows me to merge my passion for technology with my desire to create and innovate. 
                    One day, I hope to work with a tech company and play a role in the creation and testing of devices like laptops to contribute to the constantly evolving field.
